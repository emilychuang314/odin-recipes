        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Purin is a flan-like cold custard dessert in Japan. The name “Purin” comes from “pudding”, but it is not the same thing as the gooey pudding in the U.S. It has a firmer texture similar to Mexican flan and also has caramel sauce on top. It is a very basic sweet—silky, creamy, rich, and smooth—that is served chilled, and adored in Japan. Purin is a comfort dessert for Japanese people.</p>
